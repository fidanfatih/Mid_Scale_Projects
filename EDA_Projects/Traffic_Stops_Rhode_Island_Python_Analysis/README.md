***    
This analysis was performed during the Analyzing Police Activity. The data set used is provided by the Stanford Open Policing Project and represents the traffic stops of police officers in the United States in the State of Rhode Island during the years 2005 - 2015. Each line in this data set represents the stop performed by a police officer from any vehicle driver.

The data analysis is then divided into three stages:

1- Preparing the data for analysis;
2- Exploring the relationship between gender and policing; and
3- Analysis of visual exploratory data.

The dynamics of data analysis will be done through questions and answers. Therefore, several questions will be asked and soon afterwards they will be answered so that the analysis will be carried out.
